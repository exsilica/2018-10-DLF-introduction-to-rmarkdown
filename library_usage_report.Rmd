This report is based on card swipe and wifi access data from the library. It was generated on `r lubridate::stamp("January 1, 2018")(lubridate::today())`.

```{r load datasets}
wifi_dataset <- readr::read_csv(
  file.path("data", "wifi_dataset.csv")
)

card_swipe_dataset <- readr::read_csv(
  file.path("data", "card_swipe_dataset.csv")
)
```

## Overview

### Wifi access

```{r do basic analysis of wifi dataset}
earliest_wifi_date <- wifi_dataset %>% 
  dplyr::pull(date) %>% 
  min()

latest_wifi_date <- wifi_dataset %>% 
  dplyr::pull(date) %>% 
  max()

number_of_unique_wifi_users <- wifi_dataset %>% 
  pull(card_number) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  length()

number_of_wifi_events <- wifi_dataset %>% 
  nrow()
```

Between `r lubridate::stamp("January 1, 2018")(earliest_wifi_date)` and `r lubridate::stamp("January 1, 2018")(latest_wifi_date)`, `r number_of_unique_wifi_users` users performed a total of `r number_of_wifi_events` events, broken down as follows:

```{r show table of wifi event breakdown}
wifi_dataset %>% 
  dplyr::select(event) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  pander::pander()
```

Web resouce usage was not static over time, as can be seen in the visualizations below:

```{r show graphical breakdown of user usage}

wifi_events_by_month <- wifi_dataset %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    month = lubridate::stamp("2018-01", orders = "ym")(date)
  ) %>%
  group_by(
    month,
    event
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    number_of_events = n()
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()

wifi_events_by_month %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = month,
      y = number_of_events,
      fill = event
    )
  ) + 
    geom_col(
      position = "dodge"
    ) + 
    xlab("Month") + 
    ylab("Number of Events") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

wifi_events_by_month %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = month,
      y = number_of_events,
      color = event,
      group = event
    )
  ) + 
    geom_line() + 
    xlab("Month") + 
    ylab("Number of Events") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))

month_with_highest_website_usage <- wifi_events_by_month %>% 
  dplyr::filter(event == "website_access") %>% 
  dplyr::top_n(1, number_of_events) %>% 
  dplyr::pull(month) %>% 
  lubridate::ymd(truncated = 1)

month_with_highest_journal_usage <- wifi_events_by_month %>% 
  dplyr::filter(event == "journal_access") %>% 
  dplyr::top_n(1, number_of_events) %>% 
  dplyr::pull(month) %>% 
  lubridate::ymd(truncated = 1)

```

As can be seen in the visuzalization above, the month with the higest journal access usage was `r lubridate::stamp("January of 2018", order = "B Y")(month_with_highest_journal_usage)`. `r ifelse(month_with_highest_journal_usage == month_with_highest_website_usage, "Conversely, the", "The")` month with the highest website access was `r lubridate::stamp("January of 2018", order = "B Y")(month_with_highest_website_usage)`.
